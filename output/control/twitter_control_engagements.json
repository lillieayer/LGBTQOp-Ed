The citizens of Mexico are sitting ducks.\n\nDid you know there’s only ONE gun store in all of Mexico?\n\nIt’s on a military base in Mexico City and it’s Government owned and operated.\n\nThis is where Mexican citizens can shop for a gun, but there are MANY hurdles.\n\nCitizens are allowed to own one semi automatic handgun. Anything chambered in 9mm and above are prohibited for civilian use.\n\nCitizens can have up to .380 or .38 for a revolver.\n\n(Citizens are prohibited from owning ‘assault rifles.’)\n\nHOWEVER, to own a handgun you have to wait months for paperwork and legalese.\n\nYou also have to provide proof of employment, pass a medical exam, AND a psychological evaluation.\n\nIt’s pretty obvious that Mexican authorities DO NOT want Mexican citizens owning a gun.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that there are 128 million citizens in Mexico, but only 3000 people have licenses to carry.\n\nYou’d think that Mexico must be a pretty safe place. Right?\n\nWe all know that’s wrong.\n\nAround 20k people are murdered by cartels annually, around 200 are American citizens.\n\nHow can a country be so gun free yet firearms are the leading cause of death for both male AND female homicide victims?\n\nWhy does gun free Mexico have more than 4 times the gun homicides than their 2nd amendment neighbor, America?\n\nImportant questions we need to be asking.\n\nAnother example that gun control is horseshit.\n\nAn armed society is a polite society.

Can someone tell me why radical leftists are even allowed to run our elections without any chain of custody or transparency at all?\n\nAs the winner (so they can't say you're just trying to flip it) you need to send a team into all these battleground states to investigate this unbelievable fraud they've been getting away with. Once corruption has cemented itself in like this it's impossible to get rid of...because these people aren't going to just investigate and arrest themselves for fraud.\n\nWe've compiled stacks of proof over several elections...but we have no recourse here because everyone from the AG, to the SOS, to the judges are all sitting in their seats due to the same election fraud no matter the party. The Nevada GOP is just as corrupt, they've thwarted and buried every single America first candidate they've ever had...including me, I lived it.\n\nIf this country is to truly turn itself around....then it's not enough to vote en masse to beat the rig just for the presidential seat. We MUST purge fraud at the local, county, and state level to finally stop these lifetime criminals from destroying America within. ",
