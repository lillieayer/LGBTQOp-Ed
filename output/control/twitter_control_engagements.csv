https://x.com/AmiriKing/status/1857190857163800653,"Trump has declared war on the cartels and labeled them a terrorist organization.

But there’s a bigger issue.

Mexico has some of the strictest gun laws on the planet. The citizens of Mexico are sitting ducks.

Did you know there’s only ONE gun store in all of Mexico?

It’s on a military base in Mexico City and it’s Government owned and operated.

This is where Mexican citizens can shop for a gun, but there are MANY hurdles.

Citizens are allowed to own one semi automatic handgun. Anything chambered in 9mm and above are prohibited for civilian use.

Citizens can have up to .380 or .38 for a revolver.

(Citizens are prohibited from owning ‘assault rifles.’)

HOWEVER, to own a handgun you have to wait months for paperwork and legalese.

You also have to provide proof of employment, pass a medical exam, AND a psychological evaluation.

It’s pretty obvious that Mexican authorities DO NOT want Mexican citizens owning a gun.

So it should come as no surprise that there are 128 million citizens in Mexico, but only 3000 people have licenses to carry.

You’d think that Mexico must be a pretty safe place. Right?

We all know that’s wrong.

Around 20k people are murdered by cartels annually, around 200 are American citizens.

How can a country be so gun free yet firearms are the leading cause of death for both male AND female homicide victims?

Why does gun free Mexico have more than 4 times the gun homicides than their 2nd amendment neighbor, America?

Important questions we need to be asking.

Another example that gun control is horseshit.

https://x.com/iheartmindy/status/1858590601966674029,"Dear President Trump,

Corrupt Nevada officials might have allowed you to win here....but that's only because they can't afford any investigation into the fraud here otherwise. Clearly, something needs to be done about states like ours and Arizona.

In the most cowardly act imaginable, Las Vegas Clark County Commisioners in a meeting where only half of them showed up to face the public....illegally cut down public comment and testimony from voters and election poll watchers down to an impossible 1 minute, which made every instance of election fraud, mysteriously deleted ballots by the thousands, poll watchers being banned from watching, statistical impossibilities, the fact every important down ballot race switched to blue DAYS after the election, and people (like me) who's votes still have registered as counted all the more easier to ignore for these political parasites.

And for the second time a small radical leftist group that was working and imbedded with our elections the entire time testified against the citizens of Nevada on how there was no fraud at all, and then sprained their wrists congratulating themselves and government officials on the back for their glorious work. Can someone tell me why radical leftists are even allowed to run our elections without any chain of custody or transparency at all?

As the winner (so they can't say you're just trying to flip it) you need to send a team into all these battleground states to investigate this unbelievable fraud they've been getting away with. Once corruption has cemented itself in like this it's impossible to get rid of...because these people aren't going to just investigate and arrest themselves for fraud.

We've compiled stacks of proof over several elections...but we have no recourse here because everyone from the AG, to the SOS, to the judges are all sitting in their seats due to the same election fraud no matter the party. The Nevada GOP is just as corrupt, they've thwarted and buried every single America first candidate they've ever had...including me, I lived it.

If this country is to truly turn itself around....then it's not enough to vote en masse to beat the rig just for the presidential seat. We MUST purge fraud at the local, county, and state level to finally stop these lifetime criminals from destroying America within. ",Mindy MF Robinson,352.0,23.0,1082.0,"2:18 PM · Nov 18, 2024"
